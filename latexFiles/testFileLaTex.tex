\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to fully specify and outline the functional requirements of "The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)" research project, received from the Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality.

\section{Vision}

The project aims to provide an online space which will be integrated into the CS website, where students, teaching assistants, and lecturers can engage in activities
related to learning the content of our module.The system will also apply game concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation and consequently experience deeper learning of the course content.

\section{Background}
This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria having problems with the currently available tools for discussion forums, the following
problems are hampering positive engagement of both teaching staff and students: Unorganised content, user inexperience and  low levels of excitement.
\newline
The System intends to create an online discussion forum that has automated feedback on common mistakes, game-like presention as well as automated feedback. The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn about the procedures used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses, while also providing the University with a potentially new system that may, be released as an opensource project, that could possibly be implemented worldwide.

Use diagrams for points 4,5,and 6
\subsubsection{Point 1:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{Scope:}
Users should be able to create, read, update and delete posts.
\newline
\textbf{Limitations/exclusions:} Not all users should be able to use all the functions. Some users may even CRUD other users posts.

\item 
\textbf{Use case Prioritization:} Critical

\item 
\textbf{Use case/Service Contracts:} 
\newline

\textbf{Pre-Conditions: }
\begin{itemize}
\item User must be connected to the buzz system.
\item User must be registered to update and delete posts. 
\end{itemize}
 

\textbf{Post-Conditions: }
\begin{itemize}
\item User may be required to be level x, in order to update specific posts.
\item User must be level x to delete posts.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Point 2:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{Scope:}
The system must keep track of who has read what, and highlight unread messages for each user.
\newline
\textbf{Limitations/exclusions:} 

\item 
\textbf{Use case Prioritization:} Critical

\item 
\textbf{Use case/Service Contracts:} 
\newline
\textbf{Pre-Conditions: }
\begin{itemize}
\item User must be registered to the buzz system.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Point 3:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{Scope:}
This deals with the restriction of posting messages.
\newline
\textbf{Limitations/exclusions:} 
Message length should be restricted. Content type should also be restricted based on level and status of the user posting the message.

\item 
\textbf{Use case Prioritization:} Critical

\item 
\textbf{Use case/Service Contracts:} 
\newline
\textbf{Pre-Conditions: }
\begin{itemize}
