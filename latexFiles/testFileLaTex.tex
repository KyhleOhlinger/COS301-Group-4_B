\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to fully specify and outline the functional requirements of "The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)" research project, received from the Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team, of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality.

\section{Vision}

The project aims to provide an online space, which will be integrated into the CS website, where students, teaching assistants, and lecturers can engage in activities related to learning the content of specific modules. The system will also apply game-like concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation, and consequently experience a deeper understanding of the course content.

\section{Background and System Description}

This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria having problems with the currently available tools for discussion forums. The following problems are hampering positive engagement of both teaching staff and students:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unorganised content,
\item User Inexperience, and 
\item Low levels of excitement.
\end{itemize}
The System intends to create an online discussion forum that has automated feedback on common mistakes, game-like presention as well as automated structuring. \newline
The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn about the procedures used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses, while also providing the University of Pretoria with a potentially new system that may be released as an opensource project, that could possibly be implemented worldwide.
\subsection{Related Project}
The project is a face lift to the existing discussion forum of the Department of Computer Sciences, and aims to improve the existing one by bringing new features that would encourage students to be more involved in discussing certain modules.
\subsection{System Environment}
The system will interact with LDAP ,which will handle credentials avoiding the need for a database.

\section{The Stakeholders}

\subsection{The Client}
The Client is Ms Vreda Pieterse at the Department of Computer Science.
\subsection{The customers}
The Customers are Students of the Computer science who are enrolled in the modules, and lectures in the department.
\subsection{Maintenance Users}
The system will be assigned administrators from the Computer Science department and they will ensure its maintenance.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Scope and Limitations/Exclusions}
\textbf{Scope: } \newline
The scope of the Buzz System project can be encapsulated as a solution that allows the users of the system to:

\item The administrative staff should be able to manage the registration of users to the forum.
\item User has to be able to participate in discussions. 
\end{itemize}
The system shall be designed primarily for use by lecturers, teaching
assistants, and students for the core purpose of engaging in activities related to learning the content of specific modules, and increasing the participation, and consequently deeper understanding of the modules at hand. \newline

\subsubsection{Point 2: }
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Scope: }
This deals with the built in Netiquette checker. It describes the functionality of the Netiquette checker as well as its aims and goals.
\newline
\textbf{Limitations/exclusions:} 
The netiquette checker is built into the system, and is thus not an optional feature for users posting. However, the checker may be configurable (i.e. turned on and off) by board administrators.
\item 	\textbf{Use case Prioritization: } Nice-To-Have
\item 	\textbf{Use case/Service Contracts: }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\textbf{Pre-Conditions}
			\begin{itemize}
	  			\item All posts from within the website will need to be available for traversal in text format
	  			\item The netiquette checker will only check the following netiquette rules:
	  			\begin{itemize}
	  				\item Proper Spelling
	  				\item Repetition of Asked Questions
	  				\item Checking all caps
	  				\item Curse word checking
	  				\item Checking for general insults
	  			\end{itemize}
	  			\item We will need a text file containing a large list of commonly used words for the spell checker.
	  			\item We will need a text file containing a large list of commonly used curse words.
	  			\item We will need a text file containing a large list of words commonly used with the intention of insulting someone.
	  		\end{itemize}
	  		\item	\textbf{Post-Conditions}
	  		\begin{itemize}
	  			\item A moderator must be alerted if a post is detected as violating netiquette.
	  			\item The post must be highlighted to show that it violates netiquette rules.
	  			\item A moderator should be able to hide a post which violates netiquette.
	  			\item The system itself must alert the user of what netiquette rules they have violated as well as give them the opportunity to edit the post and fix them.
