\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to fully specify and outline the functional requirements of "The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)" research project, received from the Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality.

\section{Vision}

The project aims to provide an online space which will be integrated into the CS website, where students, teaching assistants, and lecturers can engage in activities
related to learning the content of our module.The system will also apply game concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation and consequently experience deeper learning of the course content.

\section{Background}
This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria having problems with the currently available tools for discussion forums, the following
problems are hampering positive engagement of both teaching staff and students: Unorganised content, user inexperience and  low levels of excitement.
\newline
The System intends to create an online discussion forum that has automated feedback on common mistakes, game-like presention as well as automated feedback. The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn about the procedures used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses, while also providing the University with a potentially new system that may, be released as an opensource project, that could possibly be implemented worldwide.

•	Restrict users to post on specified levels based on their status of the user posting the message.

Use case prioritization

Non-registered user:
User will not be able to post comment create new threads without acquiring an account.

Low level user:
When a user is on level x users may only post y number of topic or comments on other users posts per day. New posts can only be posted in pre-existing threads made by higher level users and no new threads may be made by low level users. 

Medium level user:
User may add and create any number of posts per day but are limited to the z number of threads that they can create per day.

High level user:
High level users have no posting restrictions. They made add any number of threads and are not limited to any number of posts per day.
 
All values are configurable by the Creator.
 

•	Allow staff to manage content i.e. summaries, close or hide threads and move things around.

Use case prioritization

	Important

Use case/Services contracts

Pre-Conditions:

Users may not edit, move or change another user’s posts threads or comments that are on the same or on a higher level that they are.

Post-Conditions:

Staff or high level users:
User may move threads to their relevant categories. Remove unused or unimportant threads. Lock or close threads so users cannot post within them if the topic has been already been answered. Post may be edited to fix error or to remove irrelevant data.

Medium level user:
User may move posts to the relevant threads but may not edit change or update user’s posts.

Low level and non-registered users:
User may not edit, move or change another user’s posts threads or comments.

All values are configurable by the Creator.

 

•	Provide functionality to support semi-automatic creation of thread summaries.

Use case prioritization

	Nice-to-have

Use case/Services contracts

Pre-Conditions:

Medium, High and Creator may state whether a certain thread may or may not be summarized.

Post-Conditions:
When a Thread has been marked for summary then all posts which have been highly rated and important would be moved closer to the top and unrelated or unnecessary posts would be move further away from the top to the bottom with all linked comments. High level users may override whether the summarized posts are relevant and can manually move the posts to where they best fit.

All levels of users are able to rate posts and comments on how important they see the post.

High level users would get the highest x points per rating.
Medium level users would get the highest y points per rating.
Low level users would get the highest z points per rating.
Non registered users cannot rate posts.
