\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to fully specify and outline the functional requirements of "The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)" research project, received from the Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality.

\section{Vision}

The project aims to provide an online space which will be integrated into the CS website, where students, teaching assistants, and lecturers can engage in activities
related to learning the content of our module.The system will also apply game concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation and consequently experience deeper learning of the course content.

\section{Background}
This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria having problems with the currently available tools for discussion forums, the following
problems are hampering positive engagement of both teaching staff and students: Unorganised content, user inexperience and  low levels of excitement.
\newline
The System intends to create an online discussion forum that has automated feedback on common mistakes, game-like presention as well as automated feedback. The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn about the procedures used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses, while also providing the University with a potentially new system that may, be released as an opensource project, that could possibly be implemented worldwide.
