\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to fully specify and outline the functional requirements of "The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)" research project, received from the Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team, of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality.

\section{Vision}

The project aims to provide an online space, which will be integrated into the CS website, where students, teaching assistants, and lecturers can engage in activities related to learning the content of specific modules. The system will also apply game-like concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation, and consequently experience a deeper understanding of the course content.

\section{Background and System Description}

This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria having problems with the currently available tools for discussion forums. The following problems are hampering positive engagement of both teaching staff and students:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unorganised content,
\item User Inexperience, and 
\item Low levels of excitement.
\end{itemize}
The System intends to create an online discussion forum that has automated feedback on common mistakes, game-like presention as well as automated structuring. \newline
The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn about the procedures used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses, while also providing the University of Pretoria with a potentially new system that may be released as an opensource project, that could possibly be implemented worldwide.
\subsection{Related Project}
The project is a face lift to the existing discussion forum of the Department of Computer Sciences, and aims to improve the existing one by bringing new features that would encourage students to be more involved in discussing certain modules.
\subsection{System Environment}
The system will interact with LDAP ,which will handle credentials avoiding the need for a database.

\section{The Stakeholders}

\subsection{The Client}
The Client is Ms Vreda Pieterse at the Department of Computer Science.
\subsection{The customers}
The Customers are Students of the Computer science who are enrolled in the modules, and lectures in the department.
\subsection{Maintenance Users}
The system will be assigned administrators from the Computer Science department and they will ensure its maintenance.

		  	\begin{itemize}
	  			\item A moderator must be alerted if the plagiarism percentage surpasses the allowed threshold.
		  		\item The percentage of plagiarism detected must be alerted to a moderator if it surpasses the threshold.
	 			\item If plagiarism is detected above the allowed threshold, the post must be highlighted as suspicious.
		  		\item Unique documents scanned must be added to the repository of reference documents.
